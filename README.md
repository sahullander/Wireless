# üåê Wireless Security and Research Repository 

Welcome to the **Wireless Security and Research Repository**! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of resources, information, and tools related to wireless protocols, their security, and research. Whether you are a wireless security enthusiast, a penetration tester, or a researcher, this repository serves as a valuable source of knowledge and practical guidance. There is a lot to explore, so if this your first time here we highly recommend you checkout [Getting Started](#-getting-started). As an alternative, the [Table of Contents](#-table-of-contents) section provides an outline for the entire repository!

## üöÄ Getting Started

The objectives of this repository are the following:
- **Educate**: Learn about different wireless protocols, vulnerabilities, and how to perform wireless penetration tests.
- **Document**: Find comprehensive documentation, guides, and tutorials on wireless security and pentesting techniques.
- **Create**: Join the community and contribute your own tools, scripts, and methodologies to foster collaboration and innovation in wireless pentesting.

*So, where should I start?*  We're glad you asked! The answer is.. it depends.

Below is a high-level description of each section of the repo that will help you make your decision on next steps.

#### üìÅ Protocols
The [Protocols](Protocols/) folder is the main hub for learning about different wireless protocols, vulnerabilities, and how to perform wireless penetration testing. Within this folder are subfolders for the different "groups" of wireless protocols, including *Cellular, WiFi, Bluetooth, and IoT*. Each of these "groups" have additional subfolders for specific wireless protocols. Within these sub-subfolders are where you will find details about that specific protocol, vulnerabilities, and a testing runbook that details how to exploit the protocol *(if known)*. This structure can be seen in [Table of Contents: Protocols](#protocols).

#### üìÅ Methodology
The [Methodology](Methodology/) folder provides a structured methodology that can be useful when creating runbooks, conducting assessments, and reporting findings. This helps the assessment process become more organized, enabling testers to systematically identify vulnerabilities and generate comprehensive reports. More details on the contents of this folder can been found in [Table of Contents: Methodology](#methodology).

#### üìÅ Tools and Resources
While we have made an effort to include a significant amount of information in this repository, it's important to acknowledge that the field of wireless security and research is vast and constantly evolving. Consequently, it is not feasible to cover every aspect comprehensively in a single repository. However, we recognize the importance of continuous learning and exploration in the realm of wireless security. To support your ongoing journey, we have compiled a list of [Tools and Resources](Tools_and_Resources/) that can provide valuable insights, expand your knowledge, and facilitate further exploration of this dynamic field. More details on the contents of this folder can been found in [Table of Contents: Tools and Resources](#tools-and-resources).
